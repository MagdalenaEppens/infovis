# A Tour Through the Visualization Zoo

To put the information to good use, we must find ways to explore, relate, and communicate the data meaningfully.
By making data more accessible and appealing, visual representations may also help engage more diverse audiences in exploration and analysis.
The challenge is that for any given data set the number of visual encodings is extremely large.
